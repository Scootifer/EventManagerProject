# EventManagerProject

This is a project I developed for my UCF Database Systems class COP4710.

This project is a university event management app built primarily in PHP on a MySQL database. The applciation was developed on a WAMP server and all necesarry files are include to build the project on your local PC. The goal of this project was to provide an application that would provide student organizations a place to publicly organize and document events. This project was completed alone over the course of roughly 55 hours and was to date my favorite project (both school and hobby related) to create.

Summary
This applcation is built to be fully in the browser with minimal backend work required with one exception made. In order to add a university to the system it must be manually added to the universities table. From there the application can be used without any work being done with code. University members can then be created or directly added to the system. From there University administrators can create Registered Student Organizaions (RSOs) or a user can in-conjunction with 4 other users create their own organization. The organization must then be approved by the University admin before it can be access. Creating and approving events for student organizations and the university works similarly. Comments and ratings can be left and updated on events as well.

Base Credentials Are:
root:pass //root admin user
user:pass //regular user
